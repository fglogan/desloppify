## Codex Overlay

This is the canonical Codex overlay used by the README install command.

1. Prefer first-class batch runs: `desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel --scan-after-import`.
2. The command writes immutable packet snapshots under `.desloppify/review_packets/holistic_packet_*.json`; use those for reproducible retries.
3. Keep reviewer input scoped to the immutable packet and the source files named in each batch.
4. Do not use prior chat context, score history, narrative summaries, issue labels, or target-threshold anchoring while scoring.
5. Assess every dimension listed in `query.dimensions`; never drop a requested dimension. If evidence is weak/mixed, score lower and explain uncertainty in findings.
6. Return machine-readable JSON only for review imports. For Claude session submit (`--external-submit`), include `session` from the generated template:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "<session_id_from_template>",
    "token": "<session_token_from_template>"
  },
  "assessments": {
    "<dimension_from_query>": 0
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "dimension": "<dimension_from_query>",
      "identifier": "short_id",
      "summary": "one-line defect summary",
      "related_files": ["relative/path/to/file.py"],
      "evidence": ["specific code observation"],
      "suggestion": "concrete fix recommendation",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ]
}
```

7. `findings` MUST match `query.system_prompt` exactly (including `related_files`, `evidence`, and `suggestion`). Use `"findings": []` when no defects are found.
8. Import is fail-closed by default: if any finding is invalid/skipped, `desloppify review --import` aborts unless `--allow-partial` is explicitly passed.
9. Assessment scores are auto-applied from trusted internal run-batches imports, or via Claude cloud session imports (`desloppify review --external-start --external-runner claude` then printed `--external-submit`). Legacy attested external import via `--attested-external` remains supported.
10. Manual override is safety-scoped: you cannot combine it with `--allow-partial`, and provisional manual scores expire on the next `scan` unless replaced by trusted internal or attested-external imports.
11. If a batch fails, retry only that slice with `desloppify review --run-batches --packet <packet.json> --only-batches <idxs>`.
